## VCS
> A VCS, abbreviated to Version Control System, is a system that is able to track changes that were made to a digital asset over time. 

Digital asset can be anything. A file, image, video or data. It’s most often used in software engineering, so that digital asset would be code, or a project with files full of code. It helps you keep track of your files over time, giving you the possibility to look at snapshots of your, let’s say project, at any given time. There are many advantages that come from this. If you or your team would want to look at an old version, without VCS, you would probably have the file saved somewhere. You would have to figure out what is different and where it is you are looking for. It even gets worse when working with a team. It’s gets nearly impossible trying to track all files, changes, and keeping all members up to date. While one is working on something new, the other one could still be working on something that somebody else did.
